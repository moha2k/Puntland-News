                    <h3><b>Project Number:</b> SERP-P177298</h3>
                    <h3><b>Post Title</b>: Public Sector Reform Advisor, Jubbaland</h3>
                    <h3><b>Duty Station:</b> Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Kismayo, Jubbaland state of <br>Somalia,</h3>

                    <p>The World Bank, through the Somalia Enhancing Public Resource Management Project (SERP), is supporting Somalia to improve institutions and service delivery, aiming to strengthen the social contract. This initiative is a part of a broader effort to build state legitimacy and reduce institutional fragmentation. For Somali citizens to contribute to public revenues willingly, they must trust the state’s capability to perform its basic functions and deliver public services. Similarly, trust is essential for attracting external funding for critical services and humanitarian support, such as for drought and famine, and to channel these funds through government institutions and systems. This requires enhancing the state’s institutional capacity and addressing fragmentation while also strengthening transparency and accountability in managing public resources.</p>
                    <p>SERP will assist Somali governments by focusing on the synergies and interconnectedness between improving domestic revenue mobilization (DRM), public financial management (PFM), and public sector management (PSM). Integrating revenue, expenditure, and service delivery over time will improve formal tax collection, strengthen legitimacy, and diminish the role of non- state actors. This operation consolidates the World Bank’s efforts and aims for a consistent reform agenda across the Somali peninsula, tailoring interventions to the specific needs of each government level.</p>
                    <h3><b>2. Objectives of the Job:</b></h3>
